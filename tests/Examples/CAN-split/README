-- This is an AWN specification of a fragmentation and a reassembly protocol 
-- running on top of the standardised CAN bus. It also presents a formal 
-- model of a multiplexer, a protocol that avoids the problem of priority 
-- inversion. The details are described in
--       "Split, Send, Reassemble: A Formal Specification of a CAN Bus Protocol Stack Protocol"
