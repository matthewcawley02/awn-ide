# Directory guide

## On Remote Repository:

**awn-ide-nascent**: what is hopefully the beginning of the final project. I started a new 'bare minimum' theia project in here, not fully set up though. Will not come back to for a while I think.  
**awn-language-server**: language server/client for AWN, VSCode extension.
**awn-specification**: the material Peter gave me on AWN.  
**awn-syntax-highlighter**: AWN syntax highlighting VSCode extension, using a textmate grammar.  

## On Local Repository:

**theia-example**: the "theia IDE" that works in electron. I can probably delete this but kept it here for now just because it works - could be a reference later.
**vscode-extension-samples**: Contains VSCode extension samples (offical Microsoft, hosted at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples). I have cloned a subset of them:
- **lsp-sample** Example of a language server protocol.
