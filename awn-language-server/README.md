# What is a Language Server?

This project is a "language server", a program which creates an IDE environment based on a language (in this case, AWN), using Microsoft's Language Server Protocol (LSP), an abstract protocol that describes using a programming language in an IDE. For example, the protocol specifies syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and so on. The idea is that, because LSP is abstract, it can be implemented into any IDE, regardless of the language used in the backend of that IDE.

Obviously, no language server already exists for AWN, so this project is a language server for AWN. 
VSCode (and Theia) both understand LSP - they allow LSP language servers to be extensions, which is what is done here.

The language server consists of two parts (which are each their own node.js packages): 
- The client, which interacts with the user directly, and is very light. It sends requests off to the server when the user requires information.
- The server, which is independent of the user, but is interacted with through the client. The server does all the calculations, such as building an AST, and so on.

The language server as a whole is also a node.js package.

# How syntax highlighting works

This section explains the steps for how the "server" part of the language server works for syntax highlighting, which does everything except for interacting with the user directly.

In preparation, a grammar for AWN is defined in ```awn-grammar.peg```, which is then used to create ```parser.js``` automatically and from that ```parser.ts```. This file also contains an (abstract) AST, but this AST is insufficient for the final product*, and is referred to as the "proto-AST". The final-form AST is (abstractly) defined in ```ast.ts```.

When the user edits the .awn file, the following steps are processed:

1. .awn file is converted into a proto-AST by ```parser.ts```.
2. ```convertAST.ts``` converts the proto-AST into the final-form AST.
3. ```check.ts``` checks the AST for semantic errors.

This results in either an error message to the terminal if a failure occurred, or a list of semantic highlighting tokens (this is LSP protocol) are sent to the client, which syntax highlights the documents.

*Insufficient due to a few reasons - it has unnecessary info, arrays are represented as a chain of parent-child, as are lists of binary operators, which makes the precedence info very annoying to decode.

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in this folder. This installs all necessary npm modules in both the client and server folder
- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B to start compiling the client and server in [watch mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#:~:text=The%20first%20entry%20executes,the%20HelloWorld.js%20file.).
- Switch to the Run and Debug View in the Sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D).
- Select `Launch Client` from the drop down (if it is not already).
- Press ▷ to run the launch config (F5).
- In the [Extension Development Host](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension#:~:text=Then%2C%20inside%20the%20editor%2C%20press%20F5.%20This%20will%20compile%20and%20run%20the%20extension%20in%20a%20new%20Extension%20Development%20Host%20window.) instance of VSCode, open a document in 'plain text' language mode.
  - Type `j` or `t` to see `Javascript` and `TypeScript` completion.
  - Enter text content such as `AAA aaa BBB`. The extension will emit diagnostics for all words in all-uppercase.
