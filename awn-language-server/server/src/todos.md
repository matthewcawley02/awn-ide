# TODOS

Language server
- figure out how to avoid parsing twice for every edit (one for semantic tokens another for validation)

Parser
- product ('x' in type expressions)            DONE
- custom infix functions
- partial and full set construction

Conversion from old to new AST
- convert DE tuples correctly
- ensure everything above works
- have getSemantTokens use the new AST

Syntax highlighing
- alias
