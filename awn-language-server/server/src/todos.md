# TODOS

Language server
- figure out how to avoid parsing twice for every edit (one for semantic tokens another for validation)

Parser
- get product ('x' in type expressions) to work
- get custom infix functions to work

Conversion from old to new AST
- convert DE tuples correctly
- implement conversions for the above parser things once they work
- have getSemantTokens use the new AST

Syntax highlighing
- alias
